==========
Language features:
- Value Types vs Reference Types distinction:
	- In C, which is a value type langauge, a variable is a place in memory, whereas a pointer refers to a place in memory, and the place it refers to can change over time. So consider:

	a = 1
	a = 2

		- 'a' is a memory location that stores the value 1, then is updated to store the value 2.

	- In Python, 'a' starts as a reference to an object with the value 1, then gets reassigned as a reference to an object with the value 2. 
		- Both objects continue to coexist, even though 'a' does not refer to the first one anymore; in fact, the objects may be shared by any number of other references. 

- How does this affect language features?
	- Passing variables to functions:
		- Function parameters are object references, passed by value. 




	- In CPython, only strings of length 1 are interned in the pool, i.e. a='num'; b='num'; id(a)==id(b) # true

- Comma operator: 
	a = 1
	b = 2

	a , b = b , a // Swaps
- Equality vs identity
	- Equality checks value
	- Identity checks memory location
