==========
Multithreading
- Improves performance of application.
- One task -> one worker -> one thread
	- IF task is too much for one worker, split into multiple threads!
		- Divide and conquer!
		- e.g. process million-line dataset.

Multitasking
- What is multitasking?
	- Concurrency 
- Types of multitasking:
	- Process-based
		- What is process? 
			- A program under execution.
		- Heavy-weight: 
			- Each process requires its own dedicated area of memory.
	- Thread-based
		- What is a thread?
			- A block of code that can help application to run. (See below 'TheadDemo1' example, where the error message shows the thread)
		- Light-weight: 
			- All threads share the same area of memory.

Combining both: Process-based multitasking!!
	- Divide the program into different tasks, and assign workers to them.

Efficient utilization of resources
- See above regarding heavy-weight vs light-weight; multitasking is about resources.
- CPU cores:
	- Threads can go to different CPUs.

=============
Creating threads in Java

How?
- Extending 'Thread' class (developers tend to avoid using this)
	- This is because Java does not have multiple inheritance, so this method is restrictive.
- Implementing 'Runnable' interface
- Implementing 'Callable' interface

Example:

class ThreadDemo1{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		System.out.println(10/0); 

		// Runtime exception raised.

		// A thread called 'main' is created to run this code.

		// You can see the thread in the error message: 'Exception in thread "main" 

	}
} 


class ThreadDemo2{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		Thread th = Thread.currentThread();

		System.out.println(th); 
			
		// returns: Thread[main,5,main]
	}
} 

	- Default thread priority is '5'.
		- Linked to 'priority queue' concept.
		- Priority is between 1 (min) - 10 (max)
			- e.g. mobile phone. Calls have highest priority; it will interrupt your youtube or game.
	- Thread[main,5,main]
		- The last item 'main' is the name of the thread group.	

===========
'Thread' class

Single Thread Demo:

class SingleThreadDemo{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		countUp();
		countDown();
			
	}

	public static void countUp(){

		for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
		
			System.out.println("Counting UP " + i);

		}
	}

	public static void countDown(){

		for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--){
		
			System.out.println("Counting DOWN " + i);

		}
	}
} 

Multithreading Demo:

class Thread1 extends Thread{

	public void run(){

		countUp();

	}

	public void countUp(){

		for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
		
			System.out.println("Counting UP " + i);

		}
	}
}

class Thread2 extends Thread{
	public void run(){
		countDown();
	}

	public void countDown(){

		for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--){
		
			System.out.println("Counting DOWN " + i);

		}
                      
	}   
}

class MultiThreadDemo{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		THread1 t1 = bew Tread1();

		Thread2 t2 = new Thread2();

		t1.start(); // See below for 'start' method implication

		t2.start();			
	}

}

	- Output is not sequential!
		- Sequence is dependent on the CPU (e.g. CPU is faster, then completes job quicker), the OS, or the runtime environment(e.g. one thread finished earlier).
		- Re: how runtime environment impacts sequence - see below for thread lifecycle.

==========
'Thread' class methods:

Thread lifecycle
- New
- Ready/runnable (aka waiting area)
	- Thread must move from 'new' state to 'ready' state in order to be able to do stuff.
	- This only happens when you call 'start' method on the thread object.
- 'Running' state 
	- NOTE threads can move from 'running' back to 'runnable'; it is 'bidirectional'.
		- Why? Consider
		
				Thread1 with priority '7'
				Thread2 with priority '9' is created.

				Thread1 should give way to Thread2, and therefore it will go back to 'ready' state.
					- Internally, Thread1 will call 'yield' method.
			
			- What if threads have the same priority?
				- OS handles it, e.g. round robin caching - thread requires 10 seconds; OS can only allocate 2. Thread does 2 seconds, then goes back to the queue, etc etc for 5 times. 


	- Execution of 'run' method = thread has gone into 'running' state
- 'Dead' state
	- End of 'run' method.
- 'Sleep/blocked' state
	- Thread can go from 'running' state to 'sleep' state.


==========
'Runnable' interface

class BankAccount implements Runnable{

	private int balance = 1000;

	private int withdraw;

	public BankAccount(int withdraw){
	
		this.withdraw = withdraw;

	}

	@Override
	public void run(){

		if(balance >= withdraw){
	
			System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "has withdrawn " + this.withdraw);

			balance -= withdraw;

		}
		else{

			System.out.println("Insufficient funds");

		}
	}

}

class RaceConditionDemo{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		BankAccount act = new BankAccount(1000);

		Thread t1 = new Thread(act);	

		Thread t2 = new Thread(act);	

		t1.setName("First person");

		t2.setName("Second person");

		t1.start();

		t2.start();	
	
	}

}

- 'run' method needs to be protected from multiple threads.
- How? Synchronisation:

	@Override
	public synchronized void run(){

	- What is happening?
		- Only one thread to access object; all other threads must wait.
	- It is thread safe. No other thread can access the method.
		- Thread-safety means mutually exclusive lock for threads trying to access objects.

- How to implement?
	- Synchronised methods (see above)
	- Synchronised blocks

		public void withdraw(){

			// Method logic etc etc

			synchronized(object)[ // Critical section

			}

			// The rest of the method logic etc etc
		}
- HashTable is synchronized and thread-safe; HashMap is not.
- Vector is synchronized and thread-safe; ArrayList is not.

==================
Multithreading challenges
- Race condition (see above)
- Starvation
	- e.g. One thread takes over database connection and would not release it. 'Greedy'.
		- Use 'thread-dump' to analyse.
- LiveLock
	- Thread will continue to do the same job but cannot proceed to the next job because no notification from other threads.
	- Threads must communicate with each other.
- Deadlock
	- Happens when two or more threads are all waiting for a blocked resource. Mutually blocked resources.

Shared memory; shared objects; shared resources (e.g. database connection)

===========
'callable' interface
- Example:

class NewTask implements Callable<String>{

	@Override
	public String call(){ // call method always returns an object to calling area; 'run' only executes the code
	// Therefore the return type must be the same as the specified generic type in 'Callable<>'. In this case it is 'String'

		return "Welcome";

	}

}

class CallableDemo{

	public static void main(String[] args){

		ExecutorService es = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4); // This type is required for 'Callable' object
		// This is the new way; no need to create your own threads. It does it for you.
		
		NewTask nt1 = new NewTask();

		/*

			Future vs CompletableFuture
			Blocking vs Non-blocking
		*/
		Future<String> result = es.submit(nt1);

		try{
			System.out.println(result.get());
		}
		catch(InterruptedException e){

			System.out.println(e);

		}
		catch(ExecutionException e){

			System.out.println(e);

		}	

	}

}

	- NOTE 'Executorservice' expects tasks to run; even if you don't supply it with 'es.submit' calls, it will still run in the background.
		- You need to explicitly close it via 'es.shutdown()';


See further:
- Concurrent collections, e.g. ConcurrentHashMap
- ForkJoinFramework (framework that dynamically creates and deallocates threads for you)
	- Used in Java Streams API: Collections.parallelStream() and stream().parallel() 

==========
Microservices

How are services provided?
- Desktop app
- Server (Monolithic)
- Server (Modular)

- Server
	- Break the functionality down into modules:
		- 'Modules' concept is a high-level conceptualisation (so the specification, NOT the endpoint or service - that is developer terminology). Consider: Book Store app:
			- Customer
			- Basket
			- Book
			- Payment
		- Controller and service layers etc implement these modules.
	- Monolithic vs microservices
		- Monolithic: All modules are implemented by into one executable.
			- Drawbacks:
				- Maintainability
				- Scalability
			- NOTE How is multithreading related to microservices?
		- Microservices
			- Scoped to one module, so resource constraints do not affect other modules.

- Cloud services
	- Definition: Sharing resources over a network.
	- Cloud provider provides a way to manage services (either manual or automated management)
		- 
	- Allows:
		- Rapid resourcing
	- Drawbacks
		- Complexity: 
			- Service communication: Microservices have to communicate with each other.
			- Service discovery: Keeping track of services is hard - In order to make a request, your code needs to know the network location (IP address and port) of a service instance, which can change as new services get spawned.
			- Service cost: Cloud provider usage.

========
Spring Cloud
- Contains 'service registry'
	- All apps/microservices must register with the registry. This allows them to communicate with each other. 
	- What is it for?
		- It persists service details and make them available.
	- 'Eureka server' was creataed by Netflix to support service discovery and communication. 'Apache kafka' is another one. 

- Eclipse setup
	- Create new maven project
	- In 'New Spring Starter Project Dependencies', search for 'Eureka Server' in the 'Available' section.

- Setting up the registry:
	- MUST set 'eureka.client.register-with-eureka' and 'eureka.client.fetch-registry' to 'false', otherwise your web app will be registered with the registry.
	- Use '@EurekaServer' annotation

- Now the full app:
	- This time, select 'Eureka discovery' instead of 'Eureka Server'
	- Must add '@EnableDiscoveryClient" to the 'static void main' class.
		- How is it different from the previous
			- '@EnableEurekaServer' just registers itself 

- How can a microservice communicate with other microservices?
	- Using lightweight protocols, e.g. Https
	- Spring framework provides 'RestTemplate' class to do so.
		- Firstly, services register with a service registry, e.g. Eureka server.
		- Create a RestTemplate object in your service's controller layer.
		- Then use 'RestTemplate' methods:
			- exchange(URL, http method, return item class, e.g. ResponseEntity<List<Employee>>.class)

- RestTemplate
	- What if URL is dynamic? That's where messenging services such as Apache Kafka come into play. 

Annotations
- '@SpringBootApplication' is a combination of:
	- @Configuration (so the 'main' class can also be a source of beans definition)	
	- @EnableAutoConfiguration
	- @ComponentScan
- '@Component'
	- Allows Spring to detect custom beans automatically. 
		- Without having to write any explicit code, Spring will: Scan our application for classes annotated with @Component. Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them. Inject them wherever needed.
	- If your class is in another package, e.g. com.ab.service is the main package, and com.models.entities is another package, then use '@ComponentScan({"com.models.entities"}) in your calling/autowired class.

Why use OOP for backend?
- Modular: You can plug-and-play classes and packages
