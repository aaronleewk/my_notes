==========
String handling:
- What is "String" in Java?
	- An immutable class object. I.e. its state does not change.
	- There is a difference between;

	String s1 = "hi";
	String s2 = new String("hi"); // Does not equal s1 as the two object refs are different.

	vs

	String s3 = "hi";
	String s4 = "hi"; // Equals to s3 as jvm checks string constant pool to see if object with this value exists; if so, then that object ref is assigned to s4.

- When a string method is called, the result is stored in a new object. So:

	s3.toUpperCase(); // Creates new object, but no variable to store object ref.

	String s3 = s3.toUpperCase(); // NOW s3 no longer equls to s4

- Use StringBuffer if you want to keep adding new chars.
	- It is a mutable class object.
	- It is thread-safe and synchronised.

- StringBuilder class
	- ALSO a mutable class object, BUT
	- It is NOT thread-safe
	- Introduced in Java 7

==========
Inner Classes
- "Private" classes are not allowed, UNLESS they are an inner class.
- Introduced in Java 7
- Inner classes will have their own class file in the form "Outer$Inner.class".
- They are generally used to add an additional encapsulation layer where we can write localised logic.

	class Outer{

		IClass iclass = new IClass(){ 
			public int add(int a, int b){
				return a + b;
			}
		}

		System.out.println(iclass.add(1,2));
	}
	
- Inner classes can also act as helper classes.
- Types 
	- Non-static
	- Static (static classes can ONLY exist as inner classes)
	- Local
	- Anonymous
- Syntax:
	class Outer{
		class Inner{ // default status, i.e. without access modifier, is non-static

		}

		static class SInner{

		}

		void method(){
			class LocalInnerClass{

			}
		}
	}

- NOTE: An inner class can access all members of its outer class, including those with "private" declaration.
	class Outer{
		private int x = 100;

		class Inner{
			void getX(){
				System.out.println(x); // This is valid.
			}
		}

		static class SInner{
			void getX(){

			}
		}
	}

- Accessing inner class:
	For static inner class:
	Outer.SInner sinner = new Outer.SInner();

	For other inner class types:
	class InnerClassDemo{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			Outer outer = new Outer();
			Outer.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass(); // Cannot directly access inner class; must instantiate the outer class first, THEN use that object to access the inner.
		}
	}

==================
Anonymised inner class
- Localised implementation of interfaces
	inteface Service{
		public Provide(int a);
	}

	public class AnonymousClassDemo{
		Service s = new Service(){ // Class file would be named "AnonymousClass$1" as the inner class does not have a implementation name
			public Provide(int a){
				System.out.println("Hello world");
			}
		};
	}

================
Lambda Expressions: The semantics
- A shorter version of Java method.
- Syntax of method:
	- Access specifier (optional)
	- Return type
	- Method name
	- Method parameter (optional)
	- Method body	
- Lambda expressions do not need 1,2,3 from the above syntax list. Hence why it is also known as anonymous function.
	Syntax: (method parameters) -> (method body)
- It is an alternative to anonymous inner class (see: implementation below).
- Introduced in Java8. Example:
	class Java8Features{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			List<String> cities = new ArrayList<>();
			
			cities.stream()
				  .filter(city -> city.startsWith("L"))
				  .forEach(city -> System.out.println(city));
		}
	}
- "map" is for transformation, e.g. cities.map(city -> city.toUpperCase())

========
Lambda Expressions: The implementation
- Every lambda expression is always associated with a functional interface; every lambda expression is just an anonymous inner class.

	interface IClass{ // This is a functional interface

		public int add(int a, int b);

	}

	class Outer{

		IClass iclass = (a, b) -> a + b; // lambda expression knows which method this is, because the interface only has one abstract method.

		System.out.println(iclass.add(1,2));
	}

- FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE: Lambda expression is only allowed for interfaces with ONE abstract method
- Java 8 introduced functional interfaces.
	- Existing interfaces have multiple abstract methods.
	- People were changing their interfaces to become functional interfaces, but what would happen to the existing methods? The "default" and "static" methods were introduced which allows for methods to be declared without being implemented, for backwards compatibility.

	***** Behind the scenes *********
	class Java8Features{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			List<String> cities = new ArrayList<>("London","Leeds","Dubai");
			
			cities.stream()
				  .filter(city -> city.startsWith("L"))
				  .forEach(new Consumer<String>(){
					
					public void accept (String city){
						System.out.println(city);
					}
			   	   })
		}
	}

	***** Now with lambda expression *********

	import java.util.function.Consumer; // Accepts one method "accept" and returns void

	class Java8Features{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			Map<String, Int> cities = new HashMap<>();

			cities.put("Mary", 1234);
			cities.put("John", 4321);
			
			cities.forEach( (k, v) -> System.out.println(k + ": " + v)); // This is the lambda expression that replaces anonymous classes
		}
	}


- For "filter", the source code implements a functional interface with the below semantics:

	cities.stream()
		  .filter( new Predicate<String>(){
							public boolean test(String city){
								return city.startsWith("L");
							}
					   })

- For "map", this is what happens behind the scenes:

	cities.stream()
		  .map( new Function<String,String>(){
							public String apply(String city){
								return city.toUpperCase();
							}
					   }
				)

===============
Stream Pipeline
- Comprised of the following components:
	- SINGLE data source (has to be ONLY ONE)
		- Java collections
	- Intermediate operations (0 operations or more)
		- filter, map, peek, reduce etc
	- Terminal operation (ONLY ONE) (does not return "Stream" object; instread returns a data source)
		- forEach
		- toList
		- count
		- sum
- Streams are lazy evaluated and single-use:
 
	import java.util.stream.Stream;

	ArrayList<String> lst = new ArrayList(Arrays.toList("London","Leeds","Dubai"));

	Stream<String> baseStream = lst.stream();

	List<String> var = baseStream.filter(elmt -> elmt.startsWith("R"))
			  ...
			  .collect(Collections.toList());
	
	// The below will return an error, as a stream can only be consumed once.
	baseStream.filter(elmt -> elmt.startsWith("L")) 

- Types of streams since Java 8:
	- Sequential
		- This is the default
	- Parallel
		- Used for better performance
		- Non-deterministic output


==========
Data & Time API
- What was wrong with Date & Time API in Java 6?
	- Used to be: java.util.Date
- How did Java 8 improve it?
	- Now: java.time

- LocalDate object
	- Deals with Date info only
	- Year : Month : Day of Month
- LocalTime
	- Deals with Time info only
	- Hours : Minutes : Seconds : illiseconds : Nanoseconds
- LocalDateTime
	- Deals with Date and Time

- BUT cannot instantiate these objects, i.e. new LocalDate(); is NOT allowed.
- To create:
	LocalDate date = LocalDate.now(); // Value depends on local machine

- Date & Time objects are immutable, i.e. date.plusDays(7) will not return next week's date.
	- Needs: date = date.plusDays(7);

- To create your own date object: 
	LocalDate eventDate = LocalDate.of(2023,6,15);

- "Instance" class and "Duration" class

==========
Enums
- Enum is a list of named constants (that are String values)
	enum OrderType{
		BUY,
		SELL
	}

	enum PropertyType{
		
	}

- Why use them? They are better than strings.
	- Prior to Java 6, Strings were not accepted in switch cases.
	
	switch(charac){

		case "a":
			
		case "e":
			
		case "i":
			
		case "o":
			
		case "uwu": // if you hardcode the string, you could spell it wrong.
	}

	// Use enums instead

- "Enums" can be stored in a separate file, or even package.


=========
What is a package in Java?
- Compartmentalises a group of related class files.
- Packages avoid class name collisions.

	package com.ab.daos; //com folder -> ab folder -> daos class
	import com.ab.models.Employee;
	import java.util.List;

	public interface EmployeeDAO{
		public void registerEmployee(Employee employee);
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployees();
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployeesByFirstName();
	}


	javac -d . EmployeeDAO.java // . is current directory, but any address would do.

	package com.ab.daos; 
	import com.ab.models.Employee;
	import java.util.List;

	public class EmployeeDAOInMemoryImpl implements EmployeeDAO{

		private List<Employee> employees;

		public EmployeeDAOInMemoryImpl(){
			employees = new ArrayList<>();
		}

		@Override
		public void registerEmployee(Employee employee){
			this.employees.add(employee);
		}

		@Override
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployees(){
			return this.employees;
		}

		@Override
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployeesByFirstName(String firstName){
			return this.employees.stream()
					.filter(e -> e.getFirstName().equals(firstName))
					.collect(Collectors.toListi());
		}
	}

	______
	public interface EmployeeService{
		public void registerEmployee(Employee employee);
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployees();
		public List<Employee> getAllEmployeesByFirstName();
	}


	public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService{
		private EmployeeDAO employeeDAO; // dependency object, i.e. this object depends on the stated object.

		public void EmploeeServiceImpl(EmployeeDAO employeeDAO){
			this.employeeDAO = employeeDAO;
		}

		@Override
		public void registerEmployee(Employee employee){
			this.employeeDAO.registerEemployee(employee);
		}

		// etc etc...
	}

	public class EmployeeController{
		private EmployeeServiceImp employeeServiceImpl; // dependency object

		public void EmploeeServiceImpl(EmployeeDAO employeeDAO){
			this.employeeDAO = employeeDAO;
		}

		public void registerEmployee(Employee employee){
			this.employeeDAO.registerEemployee(employee);
		}

	}


	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		EmployeeController ctrl = new EmployeeController(new EmployeeServiceImpl(new EmployeeDAOInMemoryImpl()));
	
	    ctrl.registerEmployee(new Employee(1,"Kishore","Pashindla"));
		ctrl.registerEmployee(new Employee(2,"Phil","Page"));
		
		
		System.out.println(ctrl.getAllEmployees());
		
	}
